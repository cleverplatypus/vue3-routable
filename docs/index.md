## Why Vue3 Routable?

Are you tired of the complexity that comes with Vuex or Pinia for simple route-based state management? Vue3 Routable brings the simplicity of MVC patterns to Vue 3 applications, letting you organize your route logic without the overhead of global state management libraries.

### The Problem with Traditional Approaches

Most Vue applications end up with one of these common patterns:
- Scattered logic across components with no clear separation of concerns
- Heavy state management libraries for what should be simple route-based state
- Complex setup that requires extensive framework-specific knowledge

### The Vue3 Routable Solution

Vue3 Routable introduces a lightweight, decorator-based approach that:
- Keeps it simple - Use plain TypeScript classes with intuitive decorators
- Stays close to natural Vue3 and TypeScript development - Works seamlessly with existing router configurations. No additional constructs to learn.
- Scales naturally - From simple route handlers to complex lazy-loaded controllers

```typescript
import { Routable, RouteActivated, RouteDeactivated, Param } from 'vue3-routable'
import productModel from '@/models/product-model'

@Routable(/\/products\/\d+/')
class ProductController {
  @RouteActivated()
  async loadProduct(@Param('id') productId: string) {
    productModel.data = await fetchProduct(productId);
  }

  @RouteDeactivated()
  cleanup() {
    // Clean up subscriptions, timers, etc.
  }
}
```
